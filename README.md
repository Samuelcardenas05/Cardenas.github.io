### CPSC 120

* Lab 7
Lab 7 Part 2 was one of my favorites because I loved that I created a function that actually gave me results of winning a game with a card and knowing that if i Pass 21 I lose. I could give it an ace and it can calculate it as either a 1 or 11 depending on the cards handed

* Lab 12
Lab 12 Part 1 was one of my favorites as well because it allowed me to make a function so a page with different colors would pop up. This function contained colors like green blue red and it all made a rainbow color panel.

* Lab 1
Lab 1 Was actually my favorite lab for two reasons, one It was the first time I was introduced to the world of coding. Two It was an easy lab and it made me really want to make more and find out more for the next lab.
